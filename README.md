# cryptography_demo

This is a jupyter notebook about different classical cryptography algorithms. Further it discusses how the cryptosystem looks like, how to choose a key, and which attacks are available to crack the cryptosystem. The correctness of some cryptosystems are even proofed.

These cryptosystems are discussed in this notebook:
1. Caesar 
2. Affine
3. Substitution
4. Vigenere
